# Code Institute Milestone project No 1 User-Centric Frontend Development

This is the result of Code institute's Milestone project No 1:User-Centric Frontend Development. The project was a webpage for a band called ''The Monkees'' that included media sections and a contact/booking section.

Please find a deployed version of the project [here](https://chrisntaskas.github.io/codeinstitutemilestone1/#)

## UX

This webpage was designed as a single page/scroll to section mindset. That way there is a smooth and seamless transition between the sections for the user, rather than switching through tabs and additional pages and taking focus away from the art presented through the medium of a webpage. 

The media sections (photos, audio, video) have a gallery and outside links to known providers and the user can continue the journey beyond the tracks and videos presented. 

A contact form is provided for both bookings and any kind of contact to with the band.

Social buttons on the footer provide additional connection points to follow the band on social media and interact or monitor for news.

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features

Smooth scrolling is enabled and targets the respective sections. That was accomplished by targeting various "id" tags and by means of css scroll-behavior.

The Parallax effect on the background photos creates a depth that brings relevant information one level up for the user to feel an additional connection and importance. It is something However, it is disabled for devices with a screensize lower than 768px as it did not add to the experience and it made it more distracting.
